  PyWhy Causality in Practice - Lessons learned from the DAGitty user community - Johannes Textor
summary: >-
  Johannes Textor works both at the Radboud University and the Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. He is interested in leveraging causal inference methodology for the benefit of biomedical research, especially in the fields of Immunology and Tumor Immunology. 
  <br>
  <br>
  In this talk, Johannes describes his reflections on DAGitty usage by biomedical scientists and to what extent causal graphs are useful in science.  In his words, "I started developing the tool “dagitty” in 2010, first as a website, and then as an R package. I don’t know exactly how many people use this tool, but I believe it’s a substantial amount: there are ~1000 visits to the site per day, ~17000 causal diagrams have been saved on the website so far, and the two dagitty papers have ~2800 citations. Over the years, feedback from the user base has provided me with unique insights into the users’ issues and priorities. More recently, I’ve also actively tried to get insight into how dagitty (and causal diagrams more broadly) are being used and if this is actually beneficial for science (I currently have my doubts). In the talk, I’lll share some stories of these interactions and how they shaped dagitty and myself over the years."
